# ffxiv-census

A census of FFXIV characters: it fetches public character data from community sites, stores it, and serves aggregate population statistics. This document is the project's shared language.

## Character ingestion

**Census**:
The act of fetching one character's public data from a provider and storing it as this project's record of that character.
_Avoid_: ingest, ingestion

**Character census**:
A census of a character already known to the project, refreshing its stored profile and jobs; if the providers agree the character no longer exists, it is confirmed missing.
_Avoid_: re-census, recheck, profile re-census

**ID sweep**:
A census pass that probes a range of character IDs to discover which IDs exist, storing every character it finds on the spot. Its role is discovery, not freshness; discovered characters are refreshed by later character censuses.
_Avoid_: discovery (reserved for proxy discovery), auto-discovery, sweep

**ID sweep cursor**:
The persistent position of the next unprobed character ID for automatic ID sweeps. It only ever moves forward, and only after a range has been fully handed out.
_Avoid_: frontier, discovery cursor, id_sweep_state

**Achievement census**:
A character's achievement refresh. It runs against The Lodestone exclusively, updates the character's latest earned achievement and earned milestones, and triggers nothing further.
_Avoid_: milestone check, achievement refresh

**Milestone achievement**:
One of a small, curated set of achievements tracked as progress markers — the chocobo acquisition, expansion main-scenario completions, and job level caps — instead of a character's full achievement history.
_Avoid_: checkpoint, milestone (bare)

**Milestone chain**:
The ordered sequence of milestone achievements in which earning a later one implies all earlier ones. Checking walks the chain in order and stops at the first publicly visible unearned milestone.
_Avoid_: achievement chain, chain verification, sequential dependency, early exit

**Confirmed missing**:
The conclusion that a character no longer exists, reached when the providers report not-found; the character stops being part of the census from then on. A not-found from The Lodestone alone is sufficient, because it is authoritative for existence.
_Avoid_: mark deleted, confirmed not found, character gone

**Private profile**:
A character that withholds its identifying data — no race information — from public view. It is deliberately not stored and triggers nothing further.
_Avoid_: privacy skip, skipped character

**Achievements private**:
A character whose achievement history is hidden from public view. This is recorded on the character and is a valid reason for it to have no milestone records.
_Avoid_: hidden achievement list

**The Lodestone**:
FFXIV's official community site, read as web pages rather than through an official API, and the authoritative source of character existence and profile truth. Primary provider for the character census and exclusive provider for the achievement census.
_Avoid_: official API

**Tomestone**:
A third-party character site with a fast API, used as the primary provider for the ID sweep and the fallback for the character census. It indexes only a subset of Lodestone characters, which is why a Tomestone miss never settles existence by itself.

**Provider**:
One of the two character-data sources, The Lodestone or Tomestone, ordered per event into a primary and a fallback: Tomestone first for discovery, The Lodestone first for refreshes.
_Avoid_: source, dual-source

**Proxy provider**:
An external service publishing lists of free proxies, fetched by proxy discovery. Not a provider of character data.
_Avoid_: provider (for proxy lists)

## Queue and events

**Event type**:
The named kind of work a job carries — currently ID sweep, character census, achievement census, and new-proxy. It routes the job to its queue and its event handler.
_Avoid_: job type, routing key, event (bare)

**Queue job**:
One unit of asynchronous work: an event type plus its payload, published by a publisher and executed by a worker.
_Avoid_: message, task

**Publisher**:
The component or scheduled job that enqueues queue jobs and proceeds only once the broker has confirmed each one.
_Avoid_: producer, cronjob entrypoint

**Event handler**:
The domain logic registered for one event type. It processes a single job and returns the jobs that should be published next.
_Avoid_: handler (bare — this repo also has HTTP handlers)

**Worker**:
A long-running process that consumes queue jobs of one event type and dispatches them to the registered event handler.
_Avoid_: consumer, consumer process

**Chaining**:
The pattern in which a handled event causes further events to be published, forming the ingest graph — an ID sweep chains an achievement census for every character it discovers.
_Avoid_: event cascading, downstream jobs, follow-up job

**Leaf event**:
An event type that chains nothing.
_Avoid_: terminal event

**Failed queue**:
The per-event-type holding area for jobs that exhausted their retries, where they stay parked until requeued or deliberately discarded. Retry attempts before exhaustion pass back through it automatically.
_Avoid_: dead-letter queue, DLQ, retry exchange (stale phrasing)

**Push-based consumption**:
The delivery model in which the broker hands jobs to running workers as they arrive, with no polling or claiming. It replaced the project's earlier polling job table.
_Avoid_: claim loop, pull consumption

## Proxy system

**Proxy pool**:
The maintained set of free proxies that census workers rotate through as outbound addresses when contacting The Lodestone.
_Avoid_: pool, proxies (bare)

**Proxy discovery**:
The continuous fetch of proxy lists from proxy providers, registering only addresses not already in the pool.
_Avoid_: streaming discovery

**Rotating discovery client**:
The HTTP client used only to fetch proxy lists, routed through random pool proxies. It is forbidden for provider traffic.
_Avoid_: rotating proxy client, discovery HTTP client

**Proxy scan**:
The recurring re-test of pool proxies against The Lodestone that updates each proxy's status, latency, and liveness. It reads proxies straight from the database, not through the queue.
_Avoid_: scan worker, health check

**Proxy status**:
A proxy's standing in the pool: active (last test reached The Lodestone), inactive (recently failed but not written off), or dead (written off, re-tested only occasionally).
_Avoid_: health status

**Dead-scan percentage**:
The fixed share of proxy-scan capacity reserved for re-testing dead proxies, so dead re-validation and live scanning can never starve each other.
_Avoid_: dead pool (it is not a pool of proxies), dead worker percentage

**Proxy lock**:
The exclusive, time-limited hold one worker has on a proxy. Expired holds may be taken over by other workers.
_Avoid_: proxy lease

**Test-before-handout**:
The rule that a proxy is verified with a live check before a worker is ever asked to use it.
_Avoid_: blind handout

**Proxy mode**:
The census-worker mode in which every worker owns a proxy for the duration of a job and all provider requests route through it — there are no direct requests.
_Avoid_: proxied mode

**Provider cooldown**:
The temporary pause on requests to one provider after it signals a rate limit. It is never treated as a proxy failure and never triggers a proxy switch.
_Avoid_: provider pause, rate-limit error

**Immediate proxy switch**:
The policy of abandoning a proxy on its first transport-level failure rather than retrying through it.
_Avoid_: bad-proxy retry

## Statistics

**Statistics snapshot**:
The complete, versioned set of precomputed aggregates that all analytics pages and aggregate API routes serve from, replacing per-request scans of raw character data.
_Avoid_: read model, UI stats snapshot, cache (bare)

**Snapshot refresh**:
The out-of-band rebuild of the statistics snapshot that computes all aggregates in one pass and swaps the stored snapshot atomically. Overlapping refreshes are skipped.
_Avoid_: ui-stats refresh, recompute

**Snapshot cache**:
Each web process's in-memory copy of the current statistics snapshot, reloaded at most once per interval. A process with no snapshot serves an explicit unavailable state rather than falling back to raw scans.
_Avoid_: warm/cold cache, page cache

**Stats scope**:
The geographic slice a statistic is computed for: global, a region, a datacenter, or a world.
_Avoid_: aggregation scope, scope (bare)

**Demographic dimension**:
The population axis a group is counted along: race, tribe, gender, race-by-gender, or world.
_Avoid_: dimension (bare), grouping

**Activity window**:
The bounded trailing period, currently thirty days, that defines which characters count as active and bounds the date ranges a statistic may be requested for.
_Avoid_: 30-day window

**New character**:
The canonical definition of a newly created character: one that has earned the chocobo milestone, counted per UTC day.
_Avoid_: new-character series, created character, new player (players own characters; the census counts characters)

**Max-level character**:
A character whose census record shows at least one class or job at the current level cap — combat, crafting, or gathering alike — counted once per character no matter how many of its jobs sit at the cap.
_Avoid_: maxed character, max-level jobs (the census counts characters, not jobs)

**MSQ completion funnel**:
The expansion-by-expansion view of how many characters' milestone records show each expansion's main-scenario story completed, read as retention and drop-off. Characters with private or unscanned achievements are invisible to it, however far they have progressed.

**Cascading filters**:
The linked region → datacenter → world filters in which each selection narrows the next.
_Avoid_: drill-down filters

**World drill-down**:
The descent from region to datacenter to world population numbers without a full page reload.
_Avoid_: world breakdown

**World hierarchy**:
The fixed game geography mapping every world to its datacenter and every datacenter to its region.
_Avoid_: world data

## Public site

**Indexable page**:
A UI page served as complete HTML at its canonical URL and listed in the sitemap: the dashboard, races, worlds, per-world, expansions, and methodology pages. HTMX partials, the JSON API, and the disabled character pages are not indexable.
_Avoid_: SEO page, content page, crawlable page
