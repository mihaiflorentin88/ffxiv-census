# Proxy Pool

The proxy pool discovers, validates, and maintains a database of proxies that census workers use to rotate outbound IPs when hitting The Lodestone, reducing rate-limit pressure. Availability is decided by **fresh, persisted evidence** from a lease-based scanner, never by a stored status column or a wall-clock deadline computed in the application.

## Architecture

The proxy feature is a separate bounded context (`domain/proxy/`) with its own CLI commands, worker, and store. It follows the same hexagonal architecture as the census pipeline.

| Layer | Path | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Port contracts | `port/contract/proxy.go` | `ProxyProvider`, `ProxyRepository`, `ProxyRecord` (scheduling columns) |
| Port contracts | `port/contract/proxy_scan.go` | `ProxyScanStore`, `ProxyScanPolicy`, `ScanLease`, `ScanUpdate`, `ProxyChecker` typed errors, `ProxyEndpointGuard` |
| Domain service | `domain/proxy/service.go` | New-proxy ingestion |
| Domain objects | `domain/proxy/proxy.go` | `Proxy` — consumer lifecycle over `RefreshConsumerLock`, fenced `MarkFailed`, `CooldownDestination` |
| Domain scheduling | `domain/proxy/scheduling.go` | `ClassifyCheck`, `MakeScanUpdate`, `MakeConsumerFailureUpdate`, `RecoveryDelay` |
| Domain hub | `domain/proxy/hub.go` | `ProxyHub` — tested, fenced, owner-locked handout (`NewProxy`), random discovery selection |
| Domain scanner | `domain/proxy/worker/scan.go` | Single-dispatcher lease-based scan worker |
| Domain admission | `domain/proxy/worker/admission.go` | Persistent round-robin admission state |
| Domain consumer | `domain/proxy/worker/worker.go` | `new-proxy` event consumer |
| Infrastructure | `infrastructure/proxy/health.go` | General checker: complete-response GET through the proxy to the health target (default The Lodestone) |
| Infrastructure | `infrastructure/proxy/checker.go` | Destination checker: complete-response GET to The Lodestone with `Retry-After` parsing |
| Infrastructure | `infrastructure/proxy/guard.go` | `EndpointGuard` — per-replica egress circuit breaker |
| Infrastructure | `infrastructure/proxyscrape/`, `infrastructure/geonode/`, … | Discovery providers (streaming) |
| Infrastructure | `infrastructure/httpclient/proxy_client.go` | Proxy transport construction (HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, SOCKS5), cancellation-safe |
| Infrastructure | `infrastructure/postgres/repository/proxy.go`, `proxy_scan.go` | One adapter serving both `ProxyRepository` and `ProxyScanStore` |
| Mock | `mock/repository/proxy.go`, `mock/proxy/provider.go` | In-memory fakes for tests |

## CLI

```bash
# Discover proxies from configured providers, publish new-proxy events
./bin/ffxiv-census proxy discover [--limit 0]   # 0 = unlimited

# Run a long-running guarded, lease-based scan worker
./bin/ffxiv-census proxy scan -c 150            # -c = total per-replica check concurrency

# Consume new-proxy events (long-running)
./bin/ffxiv-census proxy consume -c 30
```

`proxy scan` takes no scheduling flags other than `-c`; invalid nonpositive explicit values fail startup. In Kubernetes `proxy-scan` runs as a Deployment with 5 replicas × `-c 150`; `proxy-discover` runs as a CronJob every two minutes.

## Scan pipeline

The scan worker leases due rows from three queues and runs each check inside a bounded executor. One dispatcher goroutine owns every scheduling counter, so no helper goroutine picks work on its own.

### Queues

| Queue | Eligible rows | Order | Deadline honored |
|-------|---------------|-------|------------------|
| verification | `general_healthy` | `next_attempt_at` (oldest first) | yes |
| recovery | not healthy, completed at least once | `next_attempt_at` (oldest first) | yes |
| background | not healthy | `last_completed_at` (oldest/NULL first) | no — ignores the recovery deadline, honors the common cooldown |

Long-run capacity shares default to 10/45/45 (`weight_verification`, `weight_recovery`, `weight_background`; must sum to 100). Reservations are filled verification-first; remaining free capacity is lent by round-robin borrowing. Below three slots a persistent small-worker round robin owns every admission. An empty queue never blocks the others: completions trigger immediate re-admission and a 1 s poll timer guarantees progress while nothing completes.

### Leasing and fencing

`ClaimScans` runs in one short transaction: eligible rows are locked with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` and stamped with a fresh 128-bit hex token, the claimed `observation_version`, and a lease expiry computed from database time. Claims are bounded by free capacity and a claim timeout of half the lease (lease default 30 s). A crashed process therefore holds rows only until its lease expires; expired rows are reclaimed lazily by the next eligible claim — there is no reaper, and leftover expired-lease rows are normal. `ReleaseScan` matches the captured claim version so an old process cannot clear a lease the row no longer carries.

`CompleteScan` persists one observation only if the lease token, the captured claim version, and an unexpired lease (measured against the post-lock database timestamp) all still match. A failed CAS returns `(false, nil)` and leaves every evidence column untouched; a persistence error returns an error, engages a brief exponential claim pause (100 ms doubling to 1 s ceiling), and never fabricates a completed attempt.

### Checks and classification

The general checker (`infrastructure/proxy/health.go`) performs one GET of the configured health target through the proxy — by default The Lodestone, so a passing check proves the proxy is usable for real census traffic, not merely alive. Success requires HTTP 200 plus a complete, bounded (≤512 KiB), non-empty body; body shape is the target's own concern. Every check runs under the check timeout (default 10 s); there is no direct fallback.

Outcomes are typed (`ProxyCheckKind`: `local`, `proxy`, `target`, `deadline`, `cancelled`) and decisions use `errors.As`/`errors.Is`, never error text:

- nil error → **success**
- caller cancellation or untyped errors → **inconclusive** (fail closed)
- proven proxy dial/negotiation failure → **failure**, only while the guard was healthy and unchanged across the attempt
- deadline failures → **failure** under the same guard condition, otherwise **inconclusive**
- target errors (HTTP status, payload, target TLS) → always **inconclusive**

The dispatcher re-reads the guard immediately before persistence: a guard generation change anywhere between the attempt's start snapshot and that recheck fences conclusive failure attribution into an inconclusive result. Inconclusive attempts never increment failure history; they reschedule no sooner than `inconclusive_retry` (default 60 s) and preserve the recovery step.

### Transitions

- **success** — `general_healthy = true`, latency recorded, next verification scheduled at `verification_interval` (default 60 s), recovery sequence reset.
- **failure** — `general_healthy = false`, recovery step advances (delay doubles from `recovery_base` 1 m to `recovery_cap` 15 m, bounded by `recovery_horizon` 1 h), the common repeat position moves by `min_repeat_interval` only so recovery backoff never widens the background cooldown. The historical `status` column still dead-ends at `fail_count_threshold` (5) or `dead_threshold_days` (48 h since last success, first-seen fallback); it is bookkeeping, not availability.
- **inconclusive** — no history change; retried after the floor.

Shutdown releases leases it still owns on bounded fresh contexts after a ≤5 s drain of in-flight results; anything unreleased expires and is reclaimed lazily.

### Endpoint guard

Each scan replica owns an `EndpointGuard` observing its own egress with a bounded direct request to the same health target (`control_interval`, default 30 s, ±10 % jitter, serial controls, 10 s control budget). A failed control pauses claiming until a later success; the generation counter increments on each healthy→unhealthy transition and is never reset. A healthy control never mutates proxy state. The guard gates claiming only — in-flight checks always run to completion and are fenced by generation as described above.

## Fresh availability (general vs destination health)

All consumer-facing reads share one general-health predicate:

```sql
general_healthy AND last_verified_at > <database time> - freshness_ttl
```

`freshness_ttl` defaults to 120 s and must exceed `verification_interval + test_timeout` (validated at startup). The predicate gates `ListActive`, `CountByStatus`, `ClaimProxy`, `RefreshConsumerLock`, and `RandomActive`:

- `active` = the fresh predicate holds; a historically active but non-fresh row counts as `stale`; historical `inactive`/`dead` categories are preserved.
- `ClaimProxy` and `RefreshConsumerLock` additionally require an expired/absent destination cooldown and an unlocked (or TTL-expired) row.
- `RandomActive` applies the fresh predicate and ID exclusions but no destination-cooldown filter — cooldowns gate consumers, not provider discovery.
- There is no stale fallback: a non-fresh proxy is never handed to a consumer.

When every scanner stops, fresh lists, counts, and acquisitions decay to zero within `freshness_ttl` of each row's last verification — measured at exactly this staggered 120 s boundary in the local exercise.

**Destination cooldowns** are independent: a consumer rejection from the destination (Lodestone 403/429/5xx) raises `destination_cooldown_until` to at least `database now + Retry-After` (floor `proxy.consumer.cooldown`, default 60 s) via `GREATEST`, and releases only the caller's own lock. General evidence and the scan observation version are untouched, so a 429 never marks a proxy unhealthy and never blocks scanner claims or provider discovery.

## Consumer integration (`consume --proxy`)

`ProxyHub.NewProxy(ctx, owner)` hands out a proxy only after three steps, and returns `nil` (caller retries with backoff) when any step fails:

1. `ClaimProxy` — fresh, uncooldowned, unlocked, protocol-supported row (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`), ordered by recency of proof, uptime, latency, failure count.
2. Destination check — the `DestinationChecker` (`proxy.consumer.test_url`, default The Lodestone) must return 200 with a complete body.
3. `RefreshConsumerLock` — revalidates freshness, ownership, lock validity and cooldown, extends the lock, and returns the record with the **live observation version** the consumer must present later.

Every goroutine owns exactly one proxy (`census-consume-<host>-p<pid>-w<workerID>`). Per job:

- `Proxy.CanUse` revalidates through `RefreshConsumerLock` — the historical local-status shortcut is gone; a lock lost or a freshness lapse mid-job is detected against the database.
- A typed conclusive proxy failure is persisted by `Proxy.MarkFailed` → `RecordConsumerFailure` under a CAS on the version captured **before** the job's I/O, the owner, and a still-valid lock; a stale observation is rejected and only its own lock is released. The failure transition mirrors the scanner's (recovery delay, common-cooldown move, dead thresholds) and invalidates any older scan lease.
- A typed destination rejection (`CheckTarget`, e.g. 429 with `Retry-After`) applies `CooldownDestination` and returns the delivery for a normal queue retry — no identity rotation, no failure history. Provider 429 handling keeps its existing limiter pause and never rotates the proxy.
- Local errors and cancellation release without evidence writes.
- Replacement claims are acquired before the previous lock is released (release-before-reacquire at cleanup, no hold-and-wait).

`NotifyAvailable` (wired as the scan worker's success notifier) wakes waiting consumers as soon as a scanner accepts a success.

`RandomActive`/`SwapActive` remain for the discovery pipeline only: unlocked, untested random selection over the fresh pool. They must not be used for Lodestone APIs.

### Removed interfaces

The rewrite removed, with all callers and fakes migrated: `UpdateStatus`, `UpdateScanTime`, `ListForScan`, `ListDeadForScan`, `MarkFailedProxy`, the `ExtendLock` port method (superseded by `RefreshConsumerLock`), the old narrow `Scanner`, split-pool helpers, `dead_scan_interval_days` configuration, and the `--dead-scan-percentage` CLI flag. `cmd/http` intentionally exposes no live proxy view.

## Configuration

```toml
[proxy]
test_url             = "https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/"  # general health target: proxies must prove Lodestone works
test_timeout         = "10s"                                  # per-check budget (also the stall deadline)
dead_threshold_days  = 2                                      # historical dead classification
fail_count_threshold = 5                                      # historical dead classification

[proxy.scan]
verification_interval = "60s"   # healthy-row re-verification cadence
freshness_ttl         = "120s"  # general-freshness window (> verification_interval + test_timeout)
recovery_base         = "1m"    # first failure retry delay
recovery_cap          = "15m"   # saturated failure retry delay
recovery_horizon      = "1h"    # bound on the stored recovery progression
weight_verification   = 10      # capacity shares (must sum to 100)
weight_recovery       = 45
weight_background     = 45
lease_duration        = "30s"   # scan lease (> test_timeout)
min_repeat_interval   = "1s"    # common minimum-repeat cooldown (scan_not_before)
inconclusive_retry    = "60s"   # floor for retrying inconclusive attempts
control_interval      = "30s"   # guard control cadence

[proxy.consumer]
lock_ttl             = "5m"                                    # consumer lock TTL
lodestone_rate_limit = 1.0                                     # req/s override in proxy mode
request_timeout      = "30s"                                   # proxy-aware client timeout
test_url             = "https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/"  # destination check
test_timeout         = "10s"
cooldown             = "60s"                                   # destination cooldown floor
```

`request_timeout` (30s) bounds how long one consumer HTTP attempt may hang on a stalled proxy. It stays deliberately more generous than the scanner's `test_timeout` (10s): a slow-but-alive proxy that answers a character page in 10–25s still completes, and failures fall through to queue retries rather than wasting an otherwise working identity.

Every field overrides through an environment variable named by upper-casing the key path with `.` → `_` (viper `AutomaticEnv`): `PROXY_TEST_URL`, `PROXY_SCAN_LEASE_DURATION`, `PROXY_SCAN_WEIGHT_BACKGROUND`, `PROXY_CONSUMER_LOCK_TTL`, and so on. Startup validation fails closed on impossible combinations (freshness vs verification+timeout, lease vs timeout, weights sum, nonpositive durations).

## Kubernetes deployment

```yaml
- name: proxy-scan
  replicaCount: 5
  command: [/app/ffxiv-census, proxy, scan, -c, "150"]
  env:
    - name: POSTGRES_MAX_OPEN_CONNS   # instance env replaces chart defaults
      value: "2"
    - name: POSTGRES_MAX_IDLE_CONNS
      value: "1"
  resources:
    requests: { memory: 100Mi, cpu: 500m }
    limits:   { memory: 1Gi,  cpu: 1000m }
```

**Connection budgeting is bounded by design**: each scan replica opens at most 2 database connections (1 idle), so 5 replicas contribute at most 10 backends regardless of the 750-slot check capacity. Instance `env` lists replace the chart defaults; the required queue entries (`QUEUE_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `RABBITMQ_URL`) stay in the list even though scanning bypasses RabbitMQ.

## Observability

The scanner logs one structured event per persisted attempt on the existing `slog` logger — only `accepted=true` observations are evidence, and only they count toward throughput:

```json
{"msg":"proxy_scan.completion","proxy_id":42,"queue":"verification","outcome":"success",
 "reason":"","duration":105000000,"accepted":true,"recovery_step":0,
 "previously_healthy":true,"verify_late":1000000000}
```

`queue` ∈ verification/recovery/background; `outcome` ∈ success/failure/inconclusive; `reason` is the bounded typed label; `verify_late` (when present) is how far past `next_attempt_at` the check landed. Further events: `proxy_scan.claim` (debug; queue, requested/claimed, duration), `proxy_scan.claim_error`, `proxy_scan.complete_error`, `proxy_scan.release_error`, `proxy_scan.shutdown_incomplete`, `proxy_scan.panic_recovered`, and the guard transitions `endpoint control failed; pausing scan claims` / `endpoint control succeeded; scan claims resume` (with generation). The consumer side logs `worker.proxy_acquired`, `worker.proxy_bad`, `worker.proxy_reacquired`, `worker.proxy_waiting`, and `worker.job_retry`.

Experiment/operations SQL over the same database (no separate telemetry subsystem): health totals via `CountByStatus`; oldest completed background age = `min(last_completed_at)` over not-healthy completed rows; unknown-history count = rows with `last_completed_at IS NULL`; overdue verification count = healthy rows with `next_attempt_at < now() - grace`. Distinguish locally logged attempts from accepted persisted observations by filtering `accepted=true`.

## Measured local exercise (2026-09-09)

Throwaway fixtures on one Apple M1 host: local TLS IP-echo target, HTTP CONNECT / HTTPS CONNECT / SOCKS4 / SOCKS5 proxies (100 ms forwarding delay), immediate-refusal and 10 s-stall populations; 10 000 seeded rows per run (6000 delayed-success, 3900 refusal, 100 stall); `verification_interval` 10 s, all other defaults; per-process `-c 30`; identical policy and measurement method per run; scanners ran as Linux containers, one run per dataset reset. Accepted completions counted from `accepted=true` log events only. Printed rates divide accepted completions by the full per-run wall-clock span from scanner start to shutdown completion (168 s, 171 s and 172 s respectively), which includes the startup ramp and the graceful-shutdown drain tail; the periodic CPU, connection and progress samples were taken inside the 150 s steady window and do not set the denominator.

| Scanners (-c 30 each) | Accepted completions/s | Verify lateness avg/p95 | Postgres container CPU | Scanner CPU each |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 130.4 | 54.1 s / 98.9 s | 16.9 % | 28.7 % |
| 2 | 244.3 | 39.2 s / 53.5 s | 40.6 % | 27–31 % |
| 5 | 445.7 | 18.5 s / 22.8 s | 120.4 % | 27–30 % |

Every run: zero fencing discards, zero claim/persistence errors. Throughput scaled 1.9× at two replicas and 3.4× at five while the single-container PostgreSQL instance became the binding resource (120 % CPU) — the honest ceiling in this setup, not scanner capacity (scanners stayed near 30 % CPU each with headroom on the host). No queue starved: the background sweep drained completely in each run (≤35 s at five replicas), the recovery population kept cycling, and the verification backlog shrank monotonically with replica count. Database connections matched the budget: one steady-state backend per replica (≤10 total at five replicas, sampled via `pg_stat_activity`).

Kill test: one of three replicas was `SIGKILL`ed holding 26 in-flight leases. All 26 rows were reclaimed lazily by the two survivors after the 30 s lease expiry and completed successfully; a captured pre-kill lease token replayed through `CompleteScan` was rejected (`accepted=false`, no error) by the version/token fence.

Smoke: valid bodies activated rows on all four protocols (~105 ms latency recorded); a malformed target body caused the guard to pause claiming with no failure history written (inconclusive, fail closed); refusal proxies failed conclusively in ~1.4 ms; stalls ended at the 10 s deadline (10.00–10.01 s observed); stopping all scanners decayed fresh lists, counts and acquisitions to zero across a single `freshness_ttl` window (staggered per row); hub handout required claim + destination check + freshness revalidation; three destination 429s raised only destination cooldowns (Retry-After honored) while all 20 rows' general health and verification timestamps stayed intact, and no proxy was handed out while the destination rejected.

## Coordinated rollout procedure

The scanner rewrite changes evidence columns, predicates, and consumer fencing; old and new binaries must not run against the same proxies concurrently. Roll out as a stop-the-world cutover, executed only with user authorization (the README release workflow governs image build and tag steps):

1. Stop the old proxy writers and consumers: `proxy-scan`, `proxy-new`, all `--proxy` census consumers, and `proxy-discover` CronJobs. Old live readers that serve proxy data (currently none — `cmd/http` exposes no proxy view) stop with them.
2. Migrate the schema with the new binary (`00017_proxy_scan_scheduling.sql` is embedded and self-applies on first database use). The migration adds columns and indexes; it does not backfill success — every row starts with `general_healthy = false` and will be proven fresh only by a new scan.
3. Start the new `proxy-scan` replicas. Watch `proxy_scan.completion` events, guard transitions, and `CountByStatus` until the fresh `active` count reflects real, recent evidence.
4. Start the new consumers (`proxy-new`, `--proxy` census consumers) and any proxy readers. Consumers must be the new binary: a pre-rewrite consumer cannot present an observation version and will have its failure writes fenced off.

There is no rolling mixed-binary cutover, no automatic destructive rollback (roll forward by redeploying the previous release the same way), and no synthetic backfill of availability.

## Discovery

`proxy discover` streams provider responses directly to RabbitMQ (bounded memory), deduplicates each tuple with a read-only `Exists` check before publication, and treats `--limit` as a global publication cap. Providers run sequentially in configured order; a provider lookup error fails that provider closed without publishing. The rotating discovery HTTP client uses `RandomActive` (fresh pool, ID exclusions) and swaps on 403/429/5xx or transport failure without marking proxies — provider blocks say nothing about general health.
