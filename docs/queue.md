# RabbitMQ Work Queue

ffxiv-census runs its durable async work queue on **RabbitMQ**. The broker replaces the former PostgreSQL-backed `queue_jobs` table, eliminating 30-goroutine polling and moving to push-based consumption. There is no deduplication at the queue level — database upserts in handlers are idempotent.

## Topology

The adapter declares the full topology idempotently on connection. All exchanges and queues are durable; messages are persistent.

```
census (exchange, direct)
  ├─ routing key "id-sweep"           → census.id-sweep           (queue)
  ├─ routing key "character-census"   → census.character-census   (queue)
  ├─ routing key "achievement-census" → census.achievement-census (queue)
  └─ routing key "new-proxy"          → census.new-proxy          (queue)

census.<type>.failed (queue, per event type)
  └─ x-dead-letter-exchange = census
  └─ x-dead-letter-routing-key = <type>

census.<type>.dead (queue, per event type)
  └─ terminal park: poison payloads, no-handler deliveries, and
     failed-queue ladder exhaustion; inspectable, never auto-consumed
```

Each event type gets a **main queue** (`census.<type>`) bound to the `census` exchange with routing key equal to the event type, a **failed queue** (`census.<type>.failed`) that dead-letters back to the main exchange, and a **dead queue** (`census.<type>.dead`) for terminal parking. Retry messages in the failed queue have a TTL — when the TTL expires, RabbitMQ dead-letters them back to the main queue automatically. Nothing is ever silently dropped: deliveries the consumers cannot route are parked on the dead queue.

## Message Flow

```
Publisher                     Broker                          Consumer
─────────                     ──────                          ────────
Publish(ctx, job)
  │
  ├─ exchange: census
  ├─ routing key: job.Type
  └─ body: JSON payload      census.<type> queue
                                │
                                ├─ push to consumer (job.Type comes
                                │  from the consumer tag, never the
                                │  delivery routing key)
                                │
                                │   handler(ctx, job)
                                │     ├─ success            → Ack
                                │     ├─ poison/no handler  → park on
                                │     │                        census.<type>.dead, Ack
                                │     └─ other error        → publish to
                                │           census.<type>.failed with TTL, Ack
                                │
                              census.<type>.failed
                                ├─ TTL message: expires → dead-letter → census.<type>
                                │   (retry worker also republishes on sight)
                                └─ attempts >= max_attempts → census.<type>.dead
```

## Retry Mechanism

When a handler returns an error, the adapter classifies it via `failureDecision` and the `x-attempts` header:

| Condition | Action | TTL | Result |
|-----------|--------|-----|--------|
| Error chain carries `contract.ErrPoisonPayload` (undecodable JSON, invalid range) or `contract.ErrNoHandler` (event type not registered in this process) | Publish to `census.<type>.dead` | None | Terminal park — inspectable and recoverable, never retried |
| Any other error (Lodestone challenge, timeout, 429, 5xx, connection errors) | Publish to `census.<type>.failed` | `min(5 × 2^(attempts-1), 3600)` seconds | Auto-dead-letters back to the main queue after the TTL — retried forever until the handler succeeds or acks a terminal outcome (genuine Lodestone 404/403) |

Only the handler itself can end the retry ladder, by acking a terminal outcome: handlers mark characters deleted on genuine `contract.ErrCharacterNotFound` and treat private profiles as complete. There is no attempt-based dead-lettering for retryable failures.

`max_attempts` comes from `[queue] max_attempts` (default **50** in the embedded `config.toml`, overridable via `QUEUE_MAX_ATTEMPTS`). It is the **failed-worker safety net**: a delivery that reaches `census.<type>.failed` with `attempts >= max_attempts` is dead-parked on `census.<type>.dead` instead of republished. The first backoff steps are **5, 10, 20, 40, 80** … capped at 3600s.

The attempt count is tracked in the `x-attempts` message header and incremented on every republish. The original message is always acked after the replacement publish was broker-confirmed; a failed publish Nacks with requeue so no message is lost.

## Failed-Queue Retry Worker

`ConsumeFailed` runs the `census-retry` worker: it consumes the failed queues, normalizes each delivery's event type from the **consumer tag** (`census.id-sweep.failed` → `id-sweep`), and republishes to the `census` exchange under that canonical routing key. Legacy or misrouted deliveries that arrived with prefixed routing keys (`census.census.id-sweep.failed`) are therefore routed correctly instead of dying with `no handler registered`. The worker enables publisher confirms and Acks only after the broker confirms the republish. Unknown event types dead-park on `<failed queue>.dead`.

Lifecycle logs (visible at `LOGGING_LEVEL=debug`, set on the `census-retry` deployment): `rabbitmq.failed.received` (debug), `rabbitmq.failed.republished` (info), `rabbitmq.failed.dead_letter` / `rabbitmq.failed.unknown_event` (error).

Slow acks are visible cluster-wide: any consumer whose claim→ack window exceeds 30s logs a `queue.slow_ack` warning with the event type, attempt count, and handler duration.

## Consumer Pattern

Consumption is **push-based**. The worker calls `queue.Consume` which blocks until the context is cancelled. RabbitMQ delivers messages to consumers as they arrive — no polling, no claim loops, no `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`.

```go
// contract.Queue — the simplified interface
type Queue interface {
    Publish(ctx context.Context, job QueueJob) error
    Consume(ctx context.Context, eventTypes []string, concurrency int, handler func(ctx context.Context, job QueueJob) error) error
    Close() error
}
```

**`Publish`** sends a single job to the `census` exchange with routing key = `job.Type`. The payload is JSON bytes. It uses deferred publisher confirms (`PublishWithDeferredConfirmWithContext`) so a successful return guarantees the durable target queue accepted the message. After confirmation, `Publish` drains the mandatory return channel — if RabbitMQ reports the message as unroutable, the call returns an error with the AMQP reply code and routing key. This fail-fast behaviour means callers never silently lose messages to misconfigured bindings.

**`Consume`** starts `concurrency` worker goroutines. Each worker opens a dedicated AMQP channel with `prefetch(1)`, consumes from all specified event type queues (including `.failed` queues — their deliveries are normalized to the canonical event type and dispatched normally), and dispatches messages to the handler. On handler return:
- `nil` → message is acked
- `ErrPoisonPayload` / `ErrNoHandler` in the error chain → message is dead-parked on `census.<type>.dead`
- any other error → message is forwarded to `census.<type>.failed` with a retry TTL

**Dual-context shutdown:** `Consume` creates two independent contexts:
1. **`stopClaiming`** — derived from the caller's `ctx`. When `ctx` is cancelled (SIGTERM), `stopClaiming` cancels immediately. Workers stop claiming new deliveries; any unclaimed delivery is Nack'd with `requeue=true` so RabbitMQ redelivers it to another consumer.
2. **`processCtx`** — an independent context cancelled only after all in-flight handlers have finished (`wg.Wait()`). Handlers that are already running continue to completion against `processCtx`, giving them time to finish gracefully.

This two-phase shutdown ensures no message is lost: unclaimed messages are requeued, and in-flight handlers either succeed (ack) or fail (forward to dead-letter) before the worker exits.

**Worker usage:**

```go
processJob := func(ctx context.Context, job contract.QueueJob) error {
    h, ok := handlers.Get(job.Type)
    if !ok {
        return fmt.Errorf("no handler for %s", job.Type)
    }
    next, err := h.Handle(ctx, job.Payload)
    if err != nil {
        return err // queue handles retry/dead-letter
    }
    // Publish downstream jobs individually
    for _, j := range next {
        if err := queue.Publish(ctx, j); err != nil {
            return err
        }
    }
    return nil
}

err := queue.Consume(ctx, eventTypes, concurrency, processJob)
```

Handler panics are caught with `defer/recover`, formatted with stack traces, and returned as errors — the worker goroutine does not crash.

## Configuration

```toml
[rabbitmq]
url      = "amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/ffxiv-census"
host     = "localhost"
port     = 5672
user     = "guest"
password = "guest"
vhost    = "ffxiv-census"

[queue]
max_attempts = 50
```

[queue]

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `max_attempts` | Delivery attempt budget before a message parks permanently in its failed queue |

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `url` | Full AMQP connection URL (takes precedence over individual fields) |
| `host` | RabbitMQ hostname |
| `port` | AMQP port (default 5672) |
| `user` | Authentication username |
| `password` | Authentication password |
| `vhost` | Virtual host (default `ffxiv-census`) |

If `url` is empty, it is constructed from the individual fields: `amqp://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<vhost>`.

**Environment overrides** — dots become underscores, section name is the prefix:

| Variable | Overrides |
|----------|-----------|
| `RABBITMQ_URL` | `url` |
| `RABBITMQ_HOST` | `host` |
| `RABBITMQ_PORT` | `port` |
| `RABBITMQ_USER` | `user` |
| `RABBITMQ_PASSWORD` | `password` |
| `RABBITMQ_VHOST` | `vhost` |

In Kubernetes, `RABBITMQ_USER` and `RABBITMQ_PASSWORD` are injected from Vault (`rabbitmq/prod` secret) via External Secrets Operator. The URL is constructed in the deployment env:

```yaml
- name: RABBITMQ_URL
  value: "amqp://$(RABBITMQ_USER):$(RABBITMQ_PASSWORD)@rabbitmq.default.svc.cluster.local:5672/ffxiv-census"
```

## Kubernetes Deployment

Each event type runs as a **separate Deployment** with its own replica count and concurrency setting. This allows independent scaling and restart of each consumer type.

```yaml
# k8s/values.yaml — worker instances
workers:
  instances:
    - name: census-consumer
      command: [/app/ffxiv-census, consume, --events, "id-sweep,character-census,achievement-census,id-sweep.failed,character-census.failed,achievement-census.failed", -c, "10"]
    - name: proxy-id-sweep
      command: [/app/ffxiv-census, consume, id-sweep, --proxy, -c, "25"]
    - name: proxy-character-census
      command: [/app/ffxiv-census, consume, character-census, --proxy, -c, "15"]
    - name: proxy-achievement-census
      command: [/app/ffxiv-census, consume, achievement-census, --proxy, -c, "25"]
    - name: proxy-new
      command: [/app/ffxiv-census, proxy, consume, -c, "30"]
    - name: census-retry
      command: [/app/ffxiv-census, consume, failed, --events, "id-sweep,character-census,achievement-census", -c, "1"]
```

Proxy scanning (`proxy scan`) is a separate lease-based worker that reads due rows directly from PostgreSQL and bypasses RabbitMQ entirely; see [docs/proxy.md](proxy.md). Concurrency is set per-deployment via the `-c` flag. The default is 4 if not specified. Each worker goroutine opens its own AMQP channel with `prefetch(1)`.

**Scaling:** Increase `replicaCount` or `-c` to handle higher throughput. RabbitMQ distributes messages across consumers automatically (round-robin with prefetch=1). There is no risk of double-delivery — each message is delivered to exactly one consumer.

**Graceful shutdown:** On SIGTERM, the context is cancelled. Workers stop accepting new messages and finish their current handler calls. The `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` (default 180s) gives in-flight jobs time to complete.

**`Close`** closes the publishing channel first, then the AMQP connection. Both errors are joined with `errors.Join` so callers see every failure. Channel-before-connection ordering prevents the connection from closing while a publish confirm is still in flight.

## Monitoring

RabbitMQ exposes a **management UI** on port 15672. In the cluster it is accessible via NodePort 31672:

```
http://<node-ip>:31672
```

The management UI shows:
- Queue depths and message rates per queue
- Consumer connections and channel counts
- Exchange bindings and routing
- Message rates (publish, deliver, ack)

Useful CLI commands inside the pod:

```bash
# List all queues with message counts
kubectl exec rabbitmq-0 -- rabbitmqctl list_queues -p ffxiv-census name messages consumers

# List connections
kubectl exec rabbitmq-0 -- rabbitmqctl list_connections

# Purge a queue (e.g. to clear stuck messages)
kubectl exec rabbitmq-0 -- rabbitmqctl purge_queue census.id-sweep -p ffxiv-census
```

## Migration from PostgreSQL

The `migrate queue` command moves all pending, claimed, and failed jobs from the legacy `queue_jobs` table to RabbitMQ:

```bash
# Dry run — shows what would be migrated
./bin/ffxiv-census migrate queue --dry-run

# Execute migration
./bin/ffxiv-census migrate queue
```

The command:
1. Queries all non-done jobs from `queue_jobs` (`status IN ('pending', 'claimed', 'failed')`)
2. Publishes each job individually to RabbitMQ via `queue.Publish`
3. Logs counts per event type and status
4. Deletes the migrated rows from PostgreSQL (`DELETE FROM queue_jobs WHERE status != 'done'`)

**Pre-migration steps:**

```bash
# Scale down all workers
kubectl scale deploy/ffxiv-census-worker-id-sweep --replicas=0
kubectl scale deploy/ffxiv-census-worker-character-census --replicas=0
kubectl scale deploy/ffxiv-census-worker-achievement-census --replicas=0
kubectl scale deploy/ffxiv-census-worker-proxy-id-sweep --replicas=0
kubectl scale deploy/ffxiv-census-worker-proxy-character-census --replicas=0
kubectl scale deploy/ffxiv-census-worker-proxy-achievement-census --replicas=0
kubectl scale deploy/ffxiv-census-worker-proxy-new --replicas=0
kubectl scale deploy/ffxiv-census-worker-proxy-scan --replicas=0

# Suspend cronjobs
kubectl patch cronjob publish-character -p '{"spec":{"suspend":true}}'
kubectl patch cronjob publish-id-sweep -p '{"spec":{"suspend":true}}'
kubectl patch cronjob proxy-discover -p '{"spec":{"suspend":true}}'
kubectl patch cronjob proxy-scan -p '{"spec":{"suspend":true}}'
```

**Post-migration steps:**

```bash
# Scale workers back up
kubectl scale deploy/ffxiv-census-worker-id-sweep --replicas=1
kubectl scale deploy/ffxiv-census-worker-character-census --replicas=1
kubectl scale deploy/ffxiv-census-worker-achievement-census --replicas=1
kubectl scale deploy/ffxiv-census-worker-proxy-id-sweep --replicas=1
kubectl scale deploy/ffxiv-census-worker-proxy-character-census --replicas=1
kubectl scale deploy/ffxiv-census-worker-proxy-achievement-census --replicas=1
kubectl scale deploy/ffxiv-census-worker-proxy-new --replicas=1
kubectl scale deploy/ffxiv-census-worker-proxy-scan --replicas=1

# Resume cronjobs
kubectl patch cronjob publish-character -p '{"spec":{"suspend":false}}'
kubectl patch cronjob publish-id-sweep -p '{"spec":{"suspend":false}}'
kubectl patch cronjob proxy-discover -p '{"spec":{"suspend":false}}'
kubectl patch cronjob proxy-scan -p '{"spec":{"suspend":false}}'
```

## Event Types

The queue carries events for census and proxy contexts. See `docs/events.md` for payloads and chaining details.

| Context | Events | Consumer Command |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Census | `id-sweep`, `character-census`, `achievement-census` | `ffxiv-census consume` |
| Proxy | `new-proxy` | `ffxiv-census proxy consume` |

Proxy scans are performed directly by the `proxy scan` database worker, not via RabbitMQ events. Application consumers fail fast when RabbitMQ closes their delivery channels; Kubernetes restarts them automatically.

**Handler chaining:** When a handler succeeds, it returns downstream jobs. The worker publishes each downstream job individually:
- `id-sweep` → `achievement-census` (per discovered character)
- `character-census` → `achievement-census` (per re-censused character)

The automatic ID-sweep publisher persists its next unscanned ID in
`id_sweep_state`. After every chunk in a range receives broker confirmation, the
cursor advances beyond that range even when no character was found. A partial
publish failure does not advance it, so the next invocation retries rather than
leaving an ID hole. Completion logs expose `from_id`, `to_id`, and `next_id`.

## Contract

`port/contract.Queue` (see `port/contract/queue.go`) is implemented by `infrastructure/rabbitmq` and `mock/queue` (in-memory fake for tests). The interface has four methods: `Publish`, `Consume`, `ConsumeFailed`, and `Close`. All retry and dead-letter logic is internal to the adapter — callers only see success or error from the handler.

## Connection Resilience

The RabbitMQ adapter handles connection drops with automatic reconnect. On `Publish`, if the connection is closed, it dials a new connection and channel before retrying. The topology is re-declared on reconnect (idempotent). Consumer goroutines will error and the `Consume` call will return if the connection cannot be recovered.
